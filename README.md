This App is a prototype AI-enabled intelligent algorithm for triaging patient hospital treatment. My goal is to demonstrate the capability of an algorithm to extract realistic information from referral and X-ray reports and make a decision within minutes. This demo was prepared with synthetic data. I acknowledge that a true GP referral and X-ray report will require more complex processing, which I have done in other projects. I am presenting this to demonstrate the need for AI-assisted hospital triage that will identify predefined patterns, prioritize categorization of treatments, and significantly cut down patient waiting times for treatments by classifying individual cases based on predefined guidelines such as case severity, medical history, and other factors peculiar to the hospital unit, and medical judgment defined in the algorithm. Overall,  the project structure saves lives, money, and time. The app dashboard is given in this README with the demo URL.  Please don't hesitate to contact me by email at acogugua@yahoo.com or clement.asogwa@deakin.edu.au if you are interested in receiving further information.
